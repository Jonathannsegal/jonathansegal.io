  "researchInterests": "I envision a future where first responders receive support from cutting-edge technology, ensuring consistent service quality regardless of the time. Augmented reality could be crucial in aiding healthcare workers with various tasks, from coordinating teams to remote assistance. Integrating AR headsets into the emergency medical system toolkit for first responders, EMTs, and paramedics that can enhance the speed and quality of care. Given that the U.S. EMS system is overburdened, leveraging such technological support could save lives.\n\nMy PhD work specifically focuses on how augmented and virtual reality systems can improve medical workflows. I have worked on various AR/VR applications, including education, accessibility, and teamwork. My current work is on various AR applications to support HCWs in the emergency department.",

The problems were usually related to a wide range of topics in rapid prototyping and physical computing including 3D printing, laser cutting, microcontrollers, sensors, and motors. Besides, I also provided grades and feedback on the students’ assignments and project reports together with other TAs.",

      "description": "To date, most computing technologies have primarily benefited urban, affluent, and literate people in developed regions by empowering them with more information, resources, and agency. These technologies currently exclude billions of people worldwide, such as rural residents, people with disabilities, and indigenous communities, who are too poor to afford modern devices, too remote to be connected, or too low-literate to navigate the mostly text-driven Internet. In recent years, researchers and practitioners have examined how computing technologies can be designed or appropriated to empower such underserved communities. This course introduces students to the field of Information and Communication Technologies and Development (ICTD). Through discussions of case studies from the Global South, students will study how computing technologies are used in different global development domains, such as agriculture, finance, health, social justice, and education. They will gain understanding of socio-economic, cultural, and political forces that impact technology adoption in low-resource environments and will learn to design, build, and evaluate inclusive technologies to empower marginalized people.​"
